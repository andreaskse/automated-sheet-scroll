<h2>Instructions:</h2>
1. add the extension object 'auto sheet scroll' to each sheet you wish to be part of your automated presentation (this extention object will appear as a blank section so keep it small and out of the way of your visualisations).
<br>
<br>
2. On each sheet update the settings; time delay until change and the sheet you wish to change to.
<br>
<br>
3. setup all sheets in a loop, i.e. the last sheet points back to the first one, if you wish to display a continuous loop
